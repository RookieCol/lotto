# Lotto 


Lotto is a decentralized lottery platform inspired by Otto DAO, designed for communities to create lotteries that drive social impact. It uses Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for fair and transparent draws, Automation for smooth operations, and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect multiple blockchain networks. With Coinbase Passkey Login for secure and simple onboarding and Account Abstraction to cover gas fees, Lotto ensures accessibility for all users. A portion of every lottery fund supports public goods and initiatives backed by Nouns DAO, adding a meaningful purpose to every ticket.
